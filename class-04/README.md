# Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions 

## Feedback

- A few lectures running into lab time

- The week was good.  Very busy but good, lots of new concepts to goof around with and rabbit holes to explore.

- It was chaos. This first week has been super hard.

- Intense but I feel an "ah ha" moment coming.

- Why doesn't Code Fellows work on their own sites so we don't have to look outward for learning?

- Also Flexbox Froggy was a super helpful exercise.

- TAs (not enough/not very helpful)
